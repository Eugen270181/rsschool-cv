Hello! I have been working as an "Anykey" for 18 years. I am a software-engineer by my education. But the actual experience in this field of work is not big. That is why, I had to do a many different kinds of work without going deep: web development on SMS joomla, 1C programmer, repair computers, office equipment, configure of local network.


This was the specifics of my work two years ago - many areas of work, but not going far. 
But the last two years I work with interest project of Automation production in mechanical engineering in the development environment 1ะก-enterprise.


Now I want to expand this project through additional development - a web service for exchanging information with 1C-enterprise.

## My technical stack: 
- HTML, CSS,  JavaScript(Basic); 
- PHP+SQL, CMS JOOMLA; 
- GIT, VSCode;
